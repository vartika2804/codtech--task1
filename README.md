How It Works:
- Length Score: The longer the password, the higher the score.
- Variety Score : The more varied the characters (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters), the higher the score.
- Common Pattern Score: Penalizes passwords that are commonly used or based on simple patterns.
- Uniqueness/Entropy Score: Calculates the entropy to assess the randomness and thus the uniqueness of the password.

Based on the final score, the tool provides feedback:
- Weak: Suggests making the password longer and adding variety.
- Moderate: Suggests adding more variety or making the password less predictable.
- Strong: Password is good but can be improved by increasing length or adding even more character types.
- *Very Strong*: Password is excellent in both length and complexity.

This implementation is just a basic version and can be enhanced by adding features like checking against larger databases of common passwords, detecting common substitutions (e.g., "P@ssw0rd" for "Password"), and more
